This program is a n-back game which uses different token patterns to test you memory. 
The user is given a few seconds to remember all the tokens and then must match them correctly.
The player can change the pattern of their player token using the left mouse click.
A correct match turns the game token green.
2 points are awarded for matching a token correctly on the first try.
1 point is awarded for matching it right on the second try.
0 points are awarded for matching on any further tries.
1 point is taken away for any further failed tries.
